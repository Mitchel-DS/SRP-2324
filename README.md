# SRP (Portofolio + React)

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of my REACT portofolio, a SRP project for 2 SRP's in 1 Project.

This project will be designing and developing a new version of a projet portofolio AND also learning how to use the REACT framework to make a website.

I will be following a course on how to use REACT to make custom components for your website and use that to make a nice and clean portofolio.

My goal with this project is, delivering a nice product (the protofolio) and dive into something completely new - frameworks! 

## Why react?

React is a pretty basic framework, BUT also a very reliable one. It is used (or atleast a version of it) by almost all development companies, which makes it an essential skill to learn if I want to further my carreer in the web development field.

## Product

What will I be creating. As mentioned before I will be creating a simple portofolio using REACT components for the introduction/hero, projects and contact section. it will be live to visit with a URL.

## Usage

If you want to take a look at this project for yourself you can clone this repository to your desktop, download the packages using ```npm install```. Run the application using node, by running the command ```npm run dev```. 

## Proces

Obviously I had to come up with a design first, so I started thinking about what the most important things were that I wanted to display. To keep it simple I wanted to only display:
* Some quick information (with links to social media)
* Downloadable CV
* My projects (with a link to the github)
* Little skills section
* A way of contacting me besides my social media links.

I followed a course on youtube on how to make custom components in react.

And I also used the react documenation to get started with installing a react project.

As a little extra I added a light and dark mode

## Reflection

I have made portofolios before, but not one for myself. And working with something completely new like a framework, especially REACT, was interesting and challenging to say the least. Wanting to learn REACT has been something I wanted to do for a while now, so being able to do these 2 things at the same time is just a WIN-WIN. I have to admit I only really worked with the basics up till now and the possibilities that REACT offers are a lot and I have yet to discor them all, but I do think this was a good starting point to get to know frameworks in general.

Due to the lack of time and weird situation with teachers I wasn't able to really get the most out of this project, but I will definetly work on this some more in my own time and keep working on making the best portofolio I can.

## Future updates

Some things I was able to implent were making a seperate section for every project to give the user a little bit more information about the projects. I also maybe could've added a little bit more about myself on a seperate page IF you wanted to know more about me, but that is something I have to work on and figure out.
